* My Dotfiles

This is my dotfiles repository managed with GNU Stow.

** Installation

To install the dotfiles (create symlinks to your home directory):

#+begin_src sh
make
#+end_src

Or explicitly:

#+begin_src sh
make stow
#+end_src

This runs =stow .= which creates symbolic links from your home directory to the files in this repository.

** Cleaning Up

To remove all symlinks created by stow:

#+begin_src sh
make clean
#+end_src

This runs =stow -D .= which deletes the symbolic links.

** Available Make Commands

- =make= or =make stow=: Create symbolic links using GNU Stow
- =make clean=: Remove all symbolic links created by stow

** Prerequisites

Make sure you have GNU Stow installed:

- macOS: =brew install stow=
- Ubuntu/Debian: =sudo apt install stow=
- Arch Linux: =sudo pacman -S stow=
